## Working on
CS50 AI - degrees (breath-first-search)

## Learning
code: Breath-First-Search algoritm in Python
theory: Depth-First-Search, Breath-First-Search, greedy best search, A * search, minimax, alpha-beta pruning, depth-limited minimax.

## Thoughts
Will write down the algoritm steps in my own words and try to replicate in Javascript as for this task as a lot of the base work has already been done.

Find more examples for the other types of algorithms

Create notes for each study
